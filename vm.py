If you're receiving a "VM not found" message despite the VM existing on the vCenter, it could be due to several reasons. Let's troubleshoot and refine the approach to ensure the VM can be accurately located and deleted.
Troubleshooting Steps

    Verify VM Name: Ensure that the vm_name provided in the request exactly matches the VM's name in vCenter. Names are case-sensitive. If you're using the DNS name to search for the VM, ensure that the DNS name is correctly registered and resolvable in your environment.

    Search by Inventory Path: If VMs are not being found by DNS name, consider searching by the VM's inventory path or other attributes that might be more reliable. The inventory path typically includes the datacenter and folder hierarchy in which the VM resides.

    Use a More General Search Method: Instead of using FindByDnsName, which relies on DNS resolution, you might use a more general method to search for the VM by its name across the entire inventory.

Revised Approach Using FindAllByUuid

One reliable method to find a VM is by its UUID, but if you prefer to stick with names, consider using a broader search approach. Here's an example that iterates over all VMs to find the one with the matching name:

python

def find_vm_by_name(service_instance, vm_name: str):
    content = service_instance.RetrieveContent()
    container = content.viewManager.CreateContainerView(content.rootFolder, [vim.VirtualMachine], True)
    for vm in container.view:
        if vm.name == vm_name:
            return vm
    return None

def delete_vm(service_instance, vm_name: str):
    vm = find_vm_by_name(service_instance, vm_name)
    if vm is None:
        return "VM not found"
    
    try:
        task = vm.Destroy_Task()
        WaitForTask(task)
        return "VM deleted successfully"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to delete VM: {str(e)}"
